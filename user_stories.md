## User Stories
- as a news reader, I would like to see the top 50 stories on hacker news that
  aren't tech related so that I can enjoy hacker news without "cruft".

- as a news reader, I would like the stories to be sorted by current top rating
  as provided by HN, so new/worthy news is promoted and old news stalls its way
  out

- as an admin, I would like to see all of the HN posts and then give them a
  thumbs-up or thumbs-down depending on their content whenever I visit the site
