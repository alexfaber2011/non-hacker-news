        HNers, I&#x27;ve built a lot of software in Python and Ruby over the years
        and recently, I&#x27;ve become interested in Lisp but am unsure which Lisp&#x2F;Scheme
        variant to learn for building production grade software.<p>Ideally, I would
        like to learn the most modern one i.e. robust package management, tooling,
        ecosystem, etc. Really the main requirement is that I would like to be able
        to build production ready software with a Lisp that I can use at and for my
        company.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into Clojure and like a lot about it, but don&#x27;t
        want to have to dig into the Java world. Is there any alternative out there?

        have seen many discussions about how to invest but they seem targetted at

        see how that can be achieved investing in the European bonds&#x2F;stocks.
